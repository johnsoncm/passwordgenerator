The supplied JavaScript codebase was edited to develop a useable password generator - allowing users to create strong passwords to ensure greater security.

When the user clicks the "Generate Password" button, they are presented with a series of prompts to determine:
- the length of the password (between 8 and 128 characters)
- whether they would like uppercase, lowercase, numbers and special characters in their password

Upon completing prompts a password is populated in the box on the page.

The page does not produce any errors in the console when using the inspector in Chrome DevTools.

Code workflow: 

The process is initiated when the user clicks the "Generate Password" button. 

There is an event listener attached to the generate button (located using the #generate). 

When clicked, it runs the writePassword function, which executes the production of the password.
